    <h2>Online Volenteering</h2>
      <p>I have an account on Zooniverse that allows me to volunteer for different research projects. I do things such as count birds, identify shapes of galaxies, 
        or record animal behaviors. So far I've made over 300 classifications! Many of these projects either don't have funds or personale needed to collect data, so it's very
        rewarding to know that I'm helping a good cause. My favorite projects so far have been watching the Western Burrowing owls (because they're pretty cute). Learn more 
        <a href=https://www.zooniverse.org/>here</a>.

    <h2>Opening a Redbubble Store</h2>
      <p>Redbubble is a company that allows you to upload you're own art and designs, and then people can buy them printed onto t-shirts, pins, stickers, or a bunch of
        other things. So far my biggest customers have been my family, but I did make one sticker sale to someone in Iowa. It's crazy to think that someone is walking around
        with my design. Transitioning from traditional mediums, like paper and paint to digital versions was a little rough at first, so most of my designs are pretty
        basic. But I'm always improving. Check out my store <a href="https://www.redbubble.com/people/liz-and-jim/shop?asc=u">here</a>.

<h2>Elements of AI Course</h2>
  <p>This is a 30-hour course offered by the University of Helsinki that goes through the basics of artificial intellgence and how it might impact the world going foward. I 
	  thought this was
    a really interesting topic, and I thoughougly enjoyed this course. The thing that suprised me the most how much data and statistics are connected to artifical intelligence.
    I think it will be super interesting to see how AI grows into our daily lives, espcially considering the massive amount of data being collected on us. Read more about
    the course <a href="https://www.elementsofai.com/">here</a>

<h2>Film Club</h2>
<p>My sister and I decided to use our spare time in quaratine to brush up on our cultural refferences my watching a bunch of movies. We tried to get a varety of movies
  from classics, to newer pieces, foreign films and recommendations from friends and family. We haven't finished yet, but so far we have seen 24 out of 45.

<h2>Linked-In Learning</h2>
<p>Because of the influx of online-learning, my University offered free access to Linked-In Learning, which provides courses from industry professionals on a variety of topics
  I've taken a mix of classes, everything from personal finance to how the blockchain works to finding a career path. I tried to take classes in anything that
  seemed intersting and push my comfort boundaries a little.</p>
<br>
<br>
<h2>This website!</h2>
<p>Currently, the project I'm spending the most time on is this website. I'm using a mix of free online classes and tutorials to piece together my understanding of HTML, CSS
	and JavaScript. The code can get pretty complicated pretty fast, so I apoligize if my website isn't as snazzy as other ones. I orginally started with a pre-formatted 
	page, when I didn't know how to code, but when I started updating it, being constrainted to the pre-done designs got frustrating.
