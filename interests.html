		<h2>Travel</h2>
		<h6><i>Travel makes one modest, you see what a tiny place you occupy in the world.</i>-Gustave Flaubert</h6>
		<p>I was lucky enough to attend a highschool that offered lots of travel oppurtunities and have parents who like to travel. Even though these trips are 
			stressful, full of bug bites, sunburn and jetlag, the experiences are priceless. I would love to study abroad, but with Covid-19, I might have
			to put off those plans. Right now my top three places that I'd love to visit are: Norway (northern lights), Peru (Machu Picchu) and Egypt (Pyramids of
			Giza).
		<h2>Civic Engagement</h2>
		<p>Peaceful protests are a great way to show support for oppressed communities, bring light to side-lined issues, and help to better the future of our 
			country. Even small get-togethers can have an impact. I have learned so much from getting invovled with organizations and listening to speakers at
			events like these.</p>
